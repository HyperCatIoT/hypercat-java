Hypercat libraries for java

This project houses a set of java methods and classes for manipulating Hypercats - 
that is, simple JSON container-objects that are used to carry data back and forward 
between devices and/or consumers connected to the Internet of Things.

The code is made available under the MIT licence, and has been written for the
openIOT cluster - a group of organisations set up to promote interoperability
between devices and systems.

More information about (and the specification for) Hypercat can be found here:

The javadoc for this library (included) will explain what it does, but in brief, it
contains classes that represent Hypercat, Item and Relation objects, and methods that
enable their creation (both anually and from JSON streams) and manipulation.

The project welcomes contributions by interested hackers and other ne'er-do-wells.
